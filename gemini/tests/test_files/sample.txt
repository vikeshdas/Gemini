Cloud Bigtable is an ideal solution for handling large volumes of time-series data, such as sensor data from drones, due to its low-latency,
high-throughput capabilities. Cloud Bigtable is designed to store massive amounts of structured data and allows for fast data retrieval based
on row keys, which can be structured to include timestamps. By creating a row key based on the eventâ€™s timestamp, you can achieve efficient
and consistent data retrieval in the required timestamped order. Additionally, Cloud Bigtable supports atomic updates and is optimized for 
high-speed ingestion, making it suitable for handling thousands of events per drone every hour without compromising on performance or
scalability
